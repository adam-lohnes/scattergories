# Scattergories

This is a project to build out the tools needed to play a digital version of the game "Scattergories".

According to wikipedia, the game was originally published by Parker Brothers in 1988. Parker Brothers was purchased by Hasbro a few years later, and they published the game internationally under their Milton Bradley brand.

This set of tools - which includes a random letter-dice roller, a random list-generator, and a 3-minute countdown timer - was created for educational and learning purposes only, and has no affiliation with the original version.
